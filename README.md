# Coldwater Creek Developer Takehome

Thank you for taking interest in our web developer role. We are excited to see what you will create. This test is not only for us to be able to evaluate your skills but also for you to takeaway a little bit of the day to day here at coldwater creek.

## Your Task

We have a big website update and need a widget that will display products in an slider. We must have the product name, price, category link, an call to action and the slider must be fully responsive. Unfortunately, this ask came late in the development circle and you only have an hour to get something pulled together.

## Guidelines

    - This is meant to be an assignment that you spend approximately an  hour to hour and half on.  Do not feel like you need to overengineer 
    the solution feel free to use any framework, npm packages that help speed up your workflow. 
    Be biased toward the details that enhance UI/UX, accessibility and overall quality of design 
    for mobile, tablet and desktop.

    - You may use the products.json for the api data or the fake store api.

    - Think of this like an open source project. Fork this repo, use git for source control,
    put a pull request in, and send us links to the repo and github pages for our review.
